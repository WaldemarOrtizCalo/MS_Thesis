# Master of Science Thesis

This repository will be the working directory for my Masters of Science Thesis.

My work will be divided into 2 chapters. Chapter one will be evaluating intra-individual variation in resource selection patterns for White-tailed deer. Chapter two will evaluate the impacts of intra-individual variation on White-tailed deer survival.
